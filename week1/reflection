Adrian Winter -- Lab 1.1 Reflection

Top 3 things I have learned so far
1. Navigating directories with file system commands
2. Editing files with Vim
3. Writing basic shell scripts

I am excited to learn more about project management with Git and more complex coding with C.

I am worried about programming without the use of an IDE.
