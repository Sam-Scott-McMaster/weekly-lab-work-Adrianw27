One advantage I see with pointer arithmetic is efficiency. 
It is faster to use a pointer because it directly manipulates.
You do not need to use index calculations when you use a pointer.

One disadvantage is readability. Pointer arithmetic is harder to understand
than simply processing the array. This could make it error-prone, harder to debug, etc.

Personally I prefer array indexing because I find the code becomes more understanable, and 
easier to edit and debug. With that being said I do like how easy it is to 
manipulate data structures like arrays with pointers.
