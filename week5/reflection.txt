I am going to compare C to another language I have used extensively: Java

Advantage:
One advantage of C is the use of pointers, which allow you to direct manipulate memory.
Pointers give the user a lot of control over dynamic data structures such as trees, and they help memory efficiency by passing references rather than copying entire objects.
Java, on the other hand, does not allow the use of pointers, which can make code less efficient in certain scenarios.

Disadvantage:
One disadvantage that C has which Java does not is that it does not have the property of inheritance.
This is because C does not support object-oriented programming.
Inheritance is very useful to create resuseable and modular code, and can be used to relate things according to the real world.
This disadvantage also applies to other OOP principles that cannot be used in C.

Preference:
Overall, I prefer to use Java, simply because I am more comfortable using it. 
This could certainly change the more I use C and understand its benefits, but I prefer programming in an object-oriented language.
I also find Java to be a much easier language to debug, and I like it for its extensive library.
