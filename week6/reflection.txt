The & operator allows you to pass a pointer as an argument,
introuding a side effect of shared access to memory locations.
I think this feature is extremely useful as it allows you to modify 
out-of-scope variables extremely easily.

The advantages are efficient data modification, as you can edit multiple
variables without returning each one, memory efficiency, as you do not 
have to pass as many variables, and flexibility, as a function can carry out
multiple tasks with one return statement.

The disadvantages are reduced testability, as their behaviour is based on values of
external variables, risk of bugs, as variables can be modified unexpectedly,
and memoru safety issues if the function is called incorrectly.
